# Personality_Prediction
The Personality Classifier is a simple machine learning project that predicts whether a person is an Extrovert or Introvert based on behavioral and psychological traits. This project explores two fundamental algorithms — K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes — to understand how different models interpret human personality patterns.
